# another-ytdl

## Purpose

I have created this small python script to ease my way of downloading and converting youtube videos.

## How to use
1. Have python installed and added to PATH (I have used Python 3.13 for this)
2. Create a virtual environment (Optional)
3. Install the required package from 'requirements.txt'
4. Have ffmpeg installed and added to PATH (here is a build for Windows [FFMpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z))
5. Add any links to a links.txt file
6. Run ytdl.py script
7. Enjoy!
